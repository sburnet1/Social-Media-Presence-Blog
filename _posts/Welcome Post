In this blog, I plan to reflect upon my experiences and observations made by utilitizing Facebook, which I have used Since April 9, 2009, and Snapchap which I have only had now for about two months, although I am finding it difficult to use Snapchat dilligently. 

Ideally, viewers will be able to see what I see while using and observing through my words in my reflective posts. 

Enjoy!
